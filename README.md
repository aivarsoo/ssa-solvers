# Gillespie Stochastic Simulation implememntation in pytorch

This library implements direct and first reaction methods for stochastic simulations of the Master equation. The code is based on PyTorch and hence can be used on CPU and GPU alike. 

## Installation 


```bash
cd ssa-solvers
pip install -e .
```

## Running test

TBD
